# OceanFleet App

## Project Overview
OceanFleet App is a Java console-based application developed to demonstrate **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** concepts and **Java Collections** through a real-world vessel performance tracking scenario.

## Objectives
- Store vessel performance details  
- Retrieve vessel information using vessel ID  
- Identify high performance vessels based on speed  
- Apply clean OOPS design principles

- ## Use Cases Implemented
- **UC1**: Create Vessel Model  
- **UC2**: Store Vessel Records using List  
- **UC3**: Retrieve Vessel by Vessel ID  
- **UC4**: Identify High Performance Vessels  
- **UC5**: Console-Based User Interaction  
- **UC6**: Refactor using OOPS Principles

- ## Version Control
- Git Flow methodology followed  
- Feature-based branching  
- Clean and structured commit history
